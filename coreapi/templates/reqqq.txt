  2. instead of the pin icon i need a chat icon 
(delete the pin icon for every files we dont need that anymore),
and clicking it will open a modal chat at the center of the screen where there will be an individual chat for some selected folders ,
the folders that should have chat will have a pattern other than every other folders which is , 
i will give some folder names and paths pattern, this should be matched at the server side - 
,G:\My Drive\2025_2026\1000.HDFC\KL02.KOL\1021007_#SANDEEP_KRISHNAN#_KOL_30.08.2025_104FMY_108BJU_703628355_CONS
,G:\My Drive\2025_2026\1000.HDFC\KL02.KOL\1021101_#SUDHI_MOL_U#_KOL_19.12.2025_118XXX_112ULP_704352783_CONS

for every folders with this pattern has to have a chat icon and clicking it has to open the chat modal,
where there has to be individual chat for every folders, we have to create the database storage and also te views for it to be functional.

   3. remove the file info at the bottom of the file explorer and add the folder info at the top of the file explorer where there should be this much details-
    1 - file downloaded date : which is the date of the files inside that folder was created or downloaded or modified date ,
    2 -  TAT : which is 3 days added to the date of modified date of the files (if the date modified is 10/01/2026 the TAT will be 13/01/2026) ,
    3 -  Site report date: it is the date in which the site report was submitted, 
         the site report file name will contain strings - 'site_report' eg: "G:\My Drive\2025_2026\Training Photos\123456789_Sanjay_an_alan_site_report_1.pdf"  , 
         the number at the begining is file name and the name is applicant name and the number at the end is revision number,
         the revision number willstart from 00 and can go on further, and the site report date should be updated on the basis of last site_report created in that folder ,
    4 -  Final report date: it is the date in which the .DSC.pdf file has been created.
    5 -  there should be a green dot and it represents , a label  ' within TAT ', which means , 
         the Final report was submitted within the 3 days of file creation , the next one is orange dot ,
         which represents a label ' Site report not submitted ' which means the site report is not submitted yet, next one is a grey dot with label 'final report pending' 
         which means the final report is not created yet. and the last a red dot with the label 'out of TAT' which means the final report is out of the TAT date.
         The folder info must be only applicable to the paths or folders that a chat is there , which means the chat appearence logic is also applicable for folder info. 
    6.  There should be banner at the top of the preview replacing the file name which should be the path of the folder and the file ,
         dont need to show the file name, only the path of the folder selected and if a file is selected show the path of the file. 
    7.  The reload is trying to reload whole folderand start index building, but what i need is : when the page is loaded the folders are loaded ,
         like that i need the folders to reload ony the file explorer and the analyse modal folder files and also the thumbnails ,
         not the whole page should be reloaded.
